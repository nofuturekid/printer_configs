#   The amount of current (in amps RMS) to configure the driver to use
#   during stepper movement. This parameter must be provided.
#hold_current:
#   The amount of current (in amps RMS) to configure the driver to use
#   when the stepper is not moving. Setting a hold_current is not
#   recommended (see TMC_Drivers.md for details). The default is to
#   not reduce the current.
sense_resistor: 0.050
#   The resistance (in ohms) of the motor sense resistor. The default
#   is 0.075 ohms.
stealthchop_threshold: 999999
#   The velocity (in mm/s) to set the "stealthChop" threshold to. When
#   set, "stealthChop" mode will be enabled if the stepper motor
#   velocity is below this value. The default is 0, which disables
#   "stealthChop" mode.

#   Set the given register during the configuration of the TMC5160
#   chip. This may be used to set custom motor parameters. The
#   defaults for each parameter are next to the parameter name in the
#   above list.
# diag0_pin: !DRIVER4_DIAG
# diag1_pin: !DRIVER4_DIAG
#   The micro-controller pin attached to one of the DIAG lines of the
#   TMC5160 chip. Only a single diag pin should be specified. The pin
#   is "active low" and is thus normally prefaced with "^!". Setting
#   this creates a "tmc5160_stepper_x:virtual_endstop" virtual pin
#   which may be used as the stepper's endstop_pin. Doing this enables
#   "sensorless homing". (Be sure to also set driver_SGT to an
#   appropriate sensitivity value.) The default is to not enable
#   sensorless homing.
